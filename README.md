# neo-js
A trivial interpreted programming language, just for fun 🐦

## TODO

- [ ] C interpreter, which takes a file that ends in `.njs`
- [ ] Read file content
- [ ] Parse content 
- [ ] Execute the program

### Syntax 

- [ ] variables declared with `let` and number of bytes _(types are specified on use, lol)_
- [ ] functions, maybe with `fn`, and number of bytes in return!
- [ ] `if`, cos we need branching baby
- [ ] `indentation` decides scopes 😎
- [ ] `print`, cos that's the least we can do _(it takes a template string, we need to decide how to print stuff)_
- [ ] +, -, \*, / _(these are enough)_

So basically we can do loops by using recursion, and we are happy! 😀
